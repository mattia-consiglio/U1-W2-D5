# EPICODE Weekly project: U1-W2

This project contains two exercises:

- Create a HTML page and styles starting from a mockup image
- Doing the JavaScript exercises in "JS Exercises/D5.js"

## What I done

1. Created the HTML page making it as close as possible to the mockup image
2. Done the JavaScript exercises, addind a variation to an existing exercise
3. Having a lot of spare time, I polished the CSS, added hover states and created the responsive styles.
